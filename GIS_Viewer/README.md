## GIS DEVS Web Viewer v2 Files
This folder contains the files necesscary to view simulation results in the GIS DEVS Web Viewer v2 (1.3)

The web viewer is located at : http://206.12.94.204:8080/arslab-web/1.3/app-gis-v2/index.html

The GIS Web viewer requires 4 files: any_name.geojson, messages.log, structure.json, visualization.json

- A geojson representing the geographical area used to generate the model input json (ottawaDA.geojson). It may have any name.

- A message log of the simulation in standard web viewer format, generated by message log parser called messages.log

- A structure file generated by the message log parser called structure.json

- A visualization file that describes the colors and states variables to be visualized, called visualization.json. The entry in the visualization file["layers"]["file"] should match the name of the geojson uploaded.
  
Some documentation on the visualization file exists, but features have since been added:

## This directory contains:

 - visualization.json - created for SIRDS model, only compadible with this model
 - ottawa - A directory to hold results of simulations using Ottawa Disemmination areas
 - example - A directory that holds an example fileset for the GIS viewer

The ottawa directory contains:

- ottawaDA.geojson and the results of simulations that have been processed by the message log parser which are ready to be uploaded to the viewer (messages.log, structure.json)
- settings - contains visualization settings, these are for the user to see and modify the visualization color scheme, however to change the visualization, the changes must be made manually to visualization.json
